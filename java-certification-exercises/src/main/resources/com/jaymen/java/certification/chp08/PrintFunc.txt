Create a new program with a nested class named PrintFunc that extends class
Print from Exercise 7.2, p. 350. In addition to just printing the value, class 
PrintFunc should first apply a Function object on the value. The class PrintFunc should
have a constructor that takes an instance of Function type as a parameter. The
evaluate() method of the class PrintFunc should use the Function object on its
argument. The evaluate() method should print and return the result. The evaluate()
method in superclass Print should be used to print the value.
The program should behave like the one in Exercise 7.2, p. 350, but this time use
the nested class PrintFunc instead of class Print.
