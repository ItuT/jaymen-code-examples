Write a program to grep a text file, i.e. find all matches for the given regular
expression in the text file. The program provides a test file, but ideally the file
name and the regular expression should be specified on the command line.
Given the test data below, the program prints:
1: [(3,4:be), (16,17:be)]
3: [(2,3:be)]
4: [(0,1:Be), (12,13:be), (22,23:be), (35,36:Be)]
