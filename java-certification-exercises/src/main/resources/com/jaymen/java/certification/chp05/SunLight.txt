The program below is supposed to calculate and print the time it takes for light
to travel from the sun to the earth. It contains some logical errors. Fix the program
so that it will compile and print the correct result when run.


public class Sunlight {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Distance from sun (150 million kilometers)
		int kmFromSun = 150000000;
		int lightSpeed = 299792458; // meters per second
		// Convert distance to meters.
		int mFromSun = kmFromSun * 1000;
		int seconds = mFromSun / lightSpeed;
		System.out.print("Light will use ");
		printTime(seconds);
		System.out.println(" to travel from the sun to the earth.");
	}
	public static void printTime(int sec) {
		int min = sec / 60;
		sec = sec - (min * 60);
		System.out.print(min + " minute(s) and " + sec + " second(s)");
	}
}
