Declare an interface called Function that has a method named evaluate that takes
an int parameter and returns an int value.

Create a class called Half that implements the Function interface. The implementation
of the method evaluate() should return the value obtained by dividing
the int argument by 2.

In a client, create a method that takes an arbitrary array of int values as a parameter,
and returns an array that has the same length, but the value of an element
in the new array is half that of the value in the corresponding element in the
array passed as the parameter. Let the implementation of this method create an
instance of Half, and use this instance to calculate values for the array that is
returned.
