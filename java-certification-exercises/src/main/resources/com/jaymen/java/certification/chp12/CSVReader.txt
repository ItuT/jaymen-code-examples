Write a method that reads input specified in Comma-Separated-Value (CSV)
format. Each line represents a record with a fixed number of fields. The fields in
each record are separated by a comma. The last field of the record is terminated
by a line separator.
The method reads the input one line at a time, and extracts the field values. The
program must ensure that the correct number of fields are specified in each record.

Given the test data below, the program prints:
[2.5, 25, 250]
[Hi, Hello, Howdy]
[2008, 2009, 2010]
[one, two, three]
